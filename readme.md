In this task you have to write a commandline program which takes strings from the standard input, processes them, and writes to the standard output.

You are free to choose one of the following tasks.

* the program takes characters from the stdin, make all characters in ASCII range lowercase, outputs to the standard output. name of the output executable should be 'lowercase'.

* program that tokenizes words it gets from the stdin. should output only words, one per line, without punctuation marks.

* program that transforms ARMSCII-8 text given to stdin to UTF-8 Unicode encoding, writes result to standard output.

* program that takes two commandline arguments, tries to open files with those names, assumes those are sorted, compares them and outputs only those lines that differ.

Program should be commited to this repository in to the separate directory. Directory name should be the user's github nick.

We will compile the program by changing in to the directory, and run 'make'. So the directory has to contain a makefile.

We recommend to use C (not C++) to solve this task, but you are free to use any programming language you prefer.

Deadline: 00:00 Thu October 4.
